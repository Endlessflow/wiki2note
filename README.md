# Wiki2note

A simple obsidian plugin that aim to allow for quick search to the wikipedia database throught the official API. If the chosen article already exist in the vault it opens it or else it creates a note in a `keyword` folder with the title of the chosen article, a summary of the article and a link to the full wikipedia article.


# Why ?

In my studying workflow keyword hunting is my first step and my vault is setup such that keywords concepts are the basic unit of knowledge.

I then use those concept and link them together with logical relationships to create propositions.

Those propositions are stored in principles/theories notes.

So the reason for wiki2note is simply that I found myself often having several keyword notes on the same topics due to simple typo or the use of different ways to formulate a same concept.

Wiki2note is my solution to this issue by using wikipedia notes as a single source of truth. It allows me to normalize the name of all my keyword notes.
